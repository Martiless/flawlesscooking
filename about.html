            <p>Hey everyone, My name is Martina and I am the owner of Flawless cooking. I am wife to my amazing husband
                Steve and mum to the cutest little girl in the world Lily.
                I love food, cooking it, eating it, spending endless hours on Instagram just looking at it.</p>
            <p>I have always had a keen interest in food and cooking ever since I was a little girl and I would help my
                mother make apple tarts by eating the apples as she cut them. This interest turned into a bit of an
                obsession when I got my first real adult job doing digital marketing for a restaurant group here in
                Cork, Ireland. When I joined the team the company had 2 restaurants and was just about to open its
                third. I was in my element. I moved on from working in restaurants to working in a cookery shop and
                school to hotels, needless to say the love of food continued through all my jobs.
            </p>
            <p>I started Flawless Cooking on Tumbler when I was in college as a way of digitally keeping track of my
                recipes and over the years if has grown Flawless Cooking Cookery School. A place where I can pass on my
                passion for cooking and backing to the next generation.</p>
