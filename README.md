# Flawless Cooking Kids Cookery School 

This is a website for kids cookery classes based in Cork. Complete with enquiry form, downloadable sample recipe and an about section. Flawless Cooking is a fictional cookery school, however, it is an actual cookery blog that I own. 
This website has been created as the first Milestone project for Code Institute's Full Stack Software Development Diploma.

## Testing:

* Tested navigation bar to make sure all links worked correctly.
* Tested "Header" logo to make sure it brought me back to the homepage.
* Tested enquiry from to make sure all the required elements were working correctly.


## Bugs:
1. Font Awesome fonts are copied into the code but when the webiste is loaded are not showing up. 
      1. I had forgotten to add the Font Awesome source code to the footer section of each page.
1. Main image not loading when page refreshed.
      1. Looked at source to make sure I was using the correct syntax, I had added in an extra full stop. Removing this extra full stop solved my issue.
1. Second image not cropping correctly.
      1. Instead of using the same method as the header image, I inserted the second image in the html as a < img > tag and styled it using CSS
1. Image and text in "Middle" would not wrap for me. 
      1. I tried a number of things including rewriting the code, troubleshooting to see if I had used the wrong code in the first place and eventually contacted the Code Institute tutors to see if I could get a better understanding as to why this was not working for me the way I wanted it to. 
      1. After speaking with a tutor I was able to see that I had to take a closer look at my margins and padding to allow both the image and text fit side my side in the designated area.
